Visual exploration and analysis of loan data

---
./data
---
All data files used throughout project.
for_vis 	- final versions used in Tableau
for_python      - used for reason classificationin py


---
./imgs
---
All images used throughout the project.


---
exploration.R
---
Data formatting and cleaning
	-Mostly minor numeric setting and ordinal ranking.
	-connected the two datasets into a 'combined' on emp_length
	
Exploratory Data Analysis
	-explored loan range possibilities.
	-numerous visual examinations in ggplot.
	-multi-linear regression.
	-logistic regression on emp _length.

NOTE: This file will not output correctly cleaned files if run linearly. 
      While I tried to keep it clean and organized, jumping back and forth
      in python and excel working with the data caused a bit of an unorganized 
      mess at the end. All visuals should still read out fine though!

---
Exploration.twb
---
Tableau file in which both further exploration and final visual creation was
conducted. Blue highlighted tabs indicate usage in final report/presentation.

NOTE: THIS IS THE DASHBOARD REFERENCED IN PRESENTATION. TO BE EMAILED OUT TO
      AUDIENCE AFTER REPORT.


---
vacuum.py
---
Python file used for classifying free-form reason column into categories.
NOTE: As with any nlp, this was a pretty manual process; After a quick eval of
      the col entries I made a dictionary of stemmed words which relate to each
      of the 8 most frequent categories. Iterating this process led to the 
      collection of stemmed words for each dictionary key. Other was used for 
      any remainders.

Other Notes
---
*If running locally, tweaks to the data import lines may be needed. I ran most
      of these before collecting the data into the ./data dir.
*I named the python file after my favorite cleaning appliance (~_^)
